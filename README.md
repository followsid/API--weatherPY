API-WeatherPy

Used Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to prove that weather gets hotter as we approach the equator.

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of randomly selected 500+ unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.

Built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
Please open WeatherPy.ipynb to view data analysis and code.
