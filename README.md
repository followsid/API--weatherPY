 objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:


Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude





Randomly selected at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
Performed a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
Included a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
Saved both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.
